# 2020-2023 Sales Performance Analysis & Dashboard
Customer Base Optimization & Growth Strategy

## 1- Project Background

Analyzed data and growth strategies from 2020 to 2023 to identify patterns that enhanced sales performance in 2023. The crucial factors **driving revenue growth were significant lead list expansion** and **strategic improvements** in our sales approach. To ensure data confidentiality, I created a synthetic dataset to represent my personal sales performance.

## 2- Dataset Overview

#### 2-1 Dataset
The 2023 results are based on historical data analysis. The dashboard shows how strategic changes led to performance improvements. It includes key insights into revenue, list quantity, and conversion rates by marketing channel effectiveness and customer demographics. By visualizing this data, the factors identified help improve data analysis and optimize sales strategies to enhance sales performance and optimize sales strategies. Based on the ratio, I created a synthetic dataset to protect sensitive information.

#### 2-2 Data Structure

**Data Structure**

**Key Features**   
`role_status`: Current role of the customer.  
`education`: Highest degree earned or current academic standing.  
`purpose`: Reason for initial consultation.  
`by_channel`: Source of customer lead.  
`non_conversion_reason`: Reason for non-conversion.


#### 2-3 Key Objectives  
1. Analyze the factors affecting sales performance, focusing on increasing revenue and improving strategies.
2. Use data visualization to analyze annual sales trends and resolve problems during off-season periods.
3. Analyze marketing channels to identify those with higher conversion rates and expand the lead lists for these channels.
4. Develop data-driven recommendations for continued growth and improve internal management effectiveness.
5. By analyzing demographic factors such as age and gender, focus on segmenting customer groups more effectively and implementing precision marketing strategies.


## 3- Executive Summary
**Overview Finding**  

During and after the Covid-19 era, sales have continued to decline with significant drops in late 2021. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year decreases: revenue by 1.7%, order volume by 10.9%and potential clientele by 24.2%. Although the conversion rate increased, I implemented exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors that could improve sales performance and set the foundation for our 2023 strategic initiatives.

Based on insights from EDA, including optimizing customer service processes, implementing targeted marketing, and managing potential clients on the CRM system, sales have continued to rise with substantial growth. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year increases: total sales reached $5.12M (+25.3% YoY), the potential clientele increased by 29.3%, and order quantity sold by 41.9%. 
The strongest marketing drivers were friend referrals, search engine marketing, and walk-in customers, each with over 40% growth in conversion.

## 4- Exploratory Data Analysis



**Sales Trend**
* Throughout and following the pandemic, with 57 orders totaling $3,112,200 in 2021 yearly revenue. This corresponds with the decline in economy-wide spending due to pandemic-induced changing consumer behavior.
* During the pandemic, despite rising overall conversion rates across marketing channels, revenue still declined. Maintaining these conversion rates while increasing potential customers could have improved overall sales.
* Total sales in 2022 reached $4,086K, representing a 31.3% increase compared to the previous year, with December marking the lowest point in both potential leads and sales volume.
* Implementation of the improvement in conversion efficiency and marketing strategy recorded revenue and order count well above the same period in 2023, up 25.3% and 41.9% respectively.

**Demographic Analysis**
* The highest number of potential customers was recorded in Q3 2023, which also had good sales performance.
* Most users are male in all, with potential customers focused on the age range of 19-27 years, especially students who represent a high portion.
* After collecting the top 10 reasons for non-conversion, the 1st reason is "cannot afford”in 2020. Offering payment plans could solve the problem.
* A high proportion of the audience consists of students. This strong focus on the student market leads to clear seasonal fluctuations in sales.


## 5- Conclusion  

Based on the demographic and sales analysis, several key insights have been identified:
* The primary customer base consists of **male college students aged 19–27**, contributing to a significant portion of total sales.
* Due to the heavy reliance on the student segment, sales exhibit **noticeable seasonal fluctuations**, especially during summer and winter breaks.
* **The student segment has a relatively short customer lifecycle.** Once students graduate, they often leave the customer base, making it difficult to build long-term customer relationships.
* In 2020, **the top reason for non-conversion was “cannot afford.”** Introducing payment plans or installment options could help reduce this barrier.
* **Q3 2023 saw the highest number of potential customers**, aligning with the strongest sales performance, indicating the success of seasonal or campaign-based strategies.
* Despite higher conversion rates across channels during the pandemic, revenue declined in 2021 due to overall decreased consumer spending.
* In contrast, **sales rebounded in 2022 (+31.3%) and further improved in 2023, with a 25.3% increase in revenue and a 41.9% increase in order volume**, highlighting the success of revised marketing strategies and conversion improvements.

  
Based on these insights, the following recommendations are proposed:
* **Diversify the customer base beyond students** to reduce overdependence on a single segment. The student segment's short lifecycle poses a challenge to building a stable long-term customer base. Expanding into young professionals or working adults could help balance the revenue structure.
* **Enhance word-of-mouth strategies such as repeat purchase incentives and referral programs.** These channels have proven effective (e.g. referrals by friends had a 53.3% conversion rate) and can help increase Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) through stronger engagement and loyalty.
* **Introduce more flexible payment options** to address affordability concerns, particularly for price-sensitive groups like students.
* **Replicate successful seasonal campaign strategies** observed in Q3 2023 to drive performance in other quarters. Focused execution and timing appear to play a critical role in lead generation and conversion.
